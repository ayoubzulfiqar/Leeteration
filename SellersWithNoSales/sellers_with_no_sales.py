    Identifies sellers who have no sales from a given list of all sellers
    and a list of sales records.

    Args:
        all_seller_ids: A list of all seller identifiers (e.g., integers, strings).
                        Duplicates in this list will be handled correctly (treated as unique sellers).
        sales_records: A list of sales records, where each record is expected
                       to contain the seller ID as its first element.
                       Example: [(seller_id, item_name), (seller_id, amount)]

    Returns:
        A list of seller IDs who have no sales, sorted in ascending order.
        The type of seller IDs in the output list matches the type of seller IDs
        provided in the input.
